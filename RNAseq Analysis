For self-learning/-reference purpose, I will post RNAseq analysis procedures below, from the very beginning of library preparation to the downstream analysis, e.g. DEG and GSEA.

RNAseq analysis workflow combines a collection of exprimental and computational methods to determine the identity and abundance of RNA sequences in biological samples.

Briefly, the workflow can be divided into the following steps:
1) isolation of RNA from e.g.,cell, tissue, whole-animal samples
2) preparation of libraries that represent RNA species in the samples
3) sequencing
4) bioinformatic data analysis

Isolation of RNA
--using kits commericially available, e.g., RNAEasy (Qiagen Hilden, Germany), TRIZOL (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) or RiboPure (Ambion, Austin, TX)
--genomic DNA contamination, using DNase to digest (DNase kits)
--require 0.1 - 10 ug of total RNA (standard library), 10 pg of RNA for high-sensitivity protocols 
--quality control (check for degradation, purity, and quantity
